# Betterfox (uncompromised edition)
[about:config](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) tweaks to enhance [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). 

## READ ME FIRST!
This is intended to be a honest, bullshit free version of Betterfox, which has been compromised by NextDNS (they have an affilate link on their README). I own nothing. NextDNS is just a worse version of Cloudflare and is very likely **NO better** than Cloudflare when it comes to privacy and or security. Secure DNS is also a joke; secure means NOTHING when Cloudflare and or NextDNS are already compromising your security, your privacy and opening the door for the NSA/CIA/FBI to access your browser. **This is just personal opinion.**

## Required reading
0) Create a [backup profile](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Backup).
1) Download the user.js file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/main/user.js) (Right click > `Save Link Asâ€¦`).
2) Review [Common Overrides](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides) and make any necessary changes.
   * See also [Optional Hardening](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Optional-Hardening) for other recommendations.
3) Open Firefox. In the URL bar, type `about:profiles` and press **Enter**.
4) For the profile you want to use (or use default), click **Open Folder** in the **Root Directory** section.
5) Move the `user.js` file into the folder.

*After restarting Firefox:*
1) Get an **ad blocker** like [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/blog/ublock-origin-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ad-blocker/) with our [recommended filters](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists#guidelines).


## Credit
* Full credit goes to the Betterfox team. It's sad to see you folks get compromised by greedy companies wanting a quick buck. I hope you folks realize what NextDNS really is and terminate your sponsorship with them.
